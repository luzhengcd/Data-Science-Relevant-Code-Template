# Steps-of-Approaching-Data-Science-Problem

This repo is primarily for sharing data science related materials that I think may be useful. In the notebook, I write basic steps of approaching a data science problem with python, which I found really frequently used in the initial stage of a ds project. You may refer to the codes if you are new to data science/analytics. I will keep updating the repo with other helpful readings I find.

Here is an outline of topics that will be potentially covered in this repo. I am in the middle of my first data science job hunting, and hope this repo would be a witness of it, hopefully as well as an inspiration for other people who are passionate about data science/data analytics but not sure how to start. 

## Stats & Probability
## A/B testing
## Machine learning model
## Algorithms
