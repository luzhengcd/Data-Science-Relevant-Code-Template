# Steps-of-Approaching-Data-Science-Problem

This repo is primarily for sharing data science related materials that I think may be useful. In the notebook, I write sample code for basic regression and classification problem with python, which I found really frequently used in the initial stage of a ds project. You may refer to the codes if you are new to data science/analytics. 

Here is an outline of topics that will be potentially covered in this repo. I am in the middle of my first data science job hunting, and hope this repo would be a witness of it, hopefully as well as an inspiration for other people who are passionate about data science/data analytics but not sure how to start. 

## A/B testing  

I just finished the udacity A/B testing project, and [here](https://github.com/luzhengcd/Udacity-A-B-Testing-Course) is the final project I did with MS excel for your reference.

## Deep Learning

* I am currently working on a series of projects from the Udacity Nano degree. Here are some [projects](https://github.com/luzhengcd/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Projects) I've done.  
* I also wrote an artical about [Back propagation](https://medium.com/@lu.zhengcd/back-propagation-and-its-implementation-details-e4a510ab71a6) in deep learning on medium to explain how back propagation works both mathmatically and intuitively. 


## Algorithms

  * Bit manipulation basic: https://ryanstutorials.net/binary-tutorial/binary-negative-numbers.php
  * I wrote an artical about Path-sum problem on Medium, feel free to [check it out](https://medium.com/@lu.zhengcd/path-in-a-binary-tree-dc18b3f31918). It's basically about how to solve path-related problem in a binary tree.
