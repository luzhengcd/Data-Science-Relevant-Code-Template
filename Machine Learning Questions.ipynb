    "You can also use cross-validation when choosing parameters for the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing I'd like to mention about cross validation is, none of the cross validation model will be used to make your prediction. Instead, you will need to retrain a new model with all training data. That would be your final model with the best set of parameters you pick.\n",
